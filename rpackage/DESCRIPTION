Description: R code to execute the medium complexity Integrated Assessment Model (MCIAM) for the assessment of Carbon Removal Obligations (CROs). 
    This R package is used to run the optimization model coded in 'GAMS' (v26.1.0, see <www.gams.com>) and using the CONOPT solver, and to read and illustrate model inputs and results. 
    GAMS and the R package 'gdxrrw' need to be installed for being able to use the CROmodel package. 
    The data used in this package were retrieved from the 'SSP scenario database' hosted by IIASA and underly the terms of use available at: <https://tntcat.iiasa.ac.at/SspDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&page=about#termsofuse>.
